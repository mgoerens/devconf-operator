# Level 3: Enable Backup and Restore for the Deployed MySQL.

Level 3 is about making backup of the operand data in any stateful data managed by the operand. You donâ€™t need to backup the CR itself or the k8s resources created by the operator as the operator should return all resources to the same state if the CR is recreated.

# Prerequisites
In order to achieve a shared disk for our workshop, we have to install a NFS Server with a respective command:

```bash
helm repo add nfs-ganesha-server-and-external-provisioner https://kubernetes-sigs.github.io/nfs-ganesha-server-and-external-provisioner

helm install nfs-release -f values.yaml nfs-ganesha-server-and-external-provisioner/nfs-server-provisioner
```

# Edit the recipe_controller.go

Use our provided patch for adding the code to implement application version update support:

```shell
$ patch --strip=1 < ${WORKSHOP_REPO}/workshop/level_2/patches/0001-application-version-update.patch
patching file internal/controller/recipe_controller.go
```

## Edit the `Recipe` CR
Include the Backup Policy Specification
```yaml
backupPolicySpec:
  volumeName: "-backup"
  schedule: "*/1 * * * *"
  timezone: "Europe/Berlin"
```
You should see the following results after one minute:
```shell
kubectl logs mysql-job-28640006-sd6ht -f
  2024/06/14 21:26:12 Waiting for: tcp://recipe-sample-mysql:3306
  2024/06/14 21:26:17 Connected to tcp://recipe-sample-mysql:3306
  => Running cron task manager in foreground
  Listening on crond, and wait...
  crond: crond (busybox 1.36.1) started, log level 8
  crond: USER root pid  20 cmd /backup.sh >> /mysql_backup.log 2>&1
  => Backup started at 2024-06-14 21:28:00
  ==> Dumping database: recipes
  ==> Compressing recipes with LEVEL 6
  ==> Creating symlink to latest backup: 202406142128.recipes.sql.gz
  => Backup process finished at 2024-06-14 21:28:00
```

Let's simulate an outage in our namespace:
```bash
kubectl delete -f samples/config/devconfcz_v1alpha1_recipe.yaml
```

Wait until you see the PersistentVolume Released:
```bash
kubectl get pv
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS     CLAIM                          STORAGECLASS   REASON   AGE
pvc-f22d6d22-72a0-4240-a908-c71a6ddcb6fd   1Gi        RWX            Retain           Released   default/recipe-sample-backup   nfs                     13m
```

Let's make the PersistVolume available again
```shell
kubectl patch pv pvc-f22d6d22-72a0-4240-a908-c71a6ddcb6fd -p '{"spec":{"claimRef": null}}'
```

The PersistVolume should present an Available status:
```shell
kubectl get pv
NAME                                       CAPACITY   ACCESS MODES   RECLAIM POLICY   STATUS      CLAIM   STORAGECLASS   REASON   AGE
pvc-f22d6d22-72a0-4240-a908-c71a6ddcb6fd   1Gi        RWX            Retain           Available   /       nfs
```

Now, as we have clared the PersistentVolume Status we should be able to put back our application and see if the Restore works:
```bash
kubectl apply -f samples/config/devconfcz_v1alpha1_recipe.yaml
```

The expected Restore results are should be like the following:

```bash
kubectl logs mysql-restore-job-bwbjq -f
  2024/06/14 21:50:44 Connected to tcp://  recipe-sample-mysql:3306
  => Restore latest backup
  => Searching database name in /backup/202406142150.  recipes.sql.gz
  => Restore database recipes from /backup/202406142150.  recipes.sql.gz
  => Restore succeeded
  => Running cron task manager in foreground
```
