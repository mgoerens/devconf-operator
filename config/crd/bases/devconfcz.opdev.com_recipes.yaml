                          Valid options are:


                          Localhost - a profile defined in a file on the node should be used.
                          RuntimeDefault - the container runtime default profile should be used.
                          Unconfined - no profile should be applied.

                      If set in both SecurityContext and PodSecurityContext, the value specified in SecurityContext takes precedence.
                      Note that this field cannot be set when spec.os.name is linux.

                          In addition, if HostProcess is true then HostNetwork must also be set to true.
